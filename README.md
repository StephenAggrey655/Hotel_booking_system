# Hotel_booking_system

This program is a simple program that is meant to simulate how the booking system works.
The user of the application checks if there are available accomodation at the hotel, and if there is, the user just go ahead and book for a room.
This makes it easy foor the user when he/she wants to check into the hotel without going through a lot of hustle to do so.
